## Dataset Description

Title: Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes
Source: NYC Open Data

Description:
The Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset encompasses detailed records of traffic collisions reported by the police across New York City. Each entry in the crash table represents an individual collision event, documented by the police via the MV-104AN form. This form is mandated for all collisions involving injury, fatality, or substantial property damage (exceeding $1000).

The dataset contains comprehensive details about each crash, including:

Location (coordinates, street names)
Time and Date of the incident
Involvement (type of vehicles, number of individuals involved)
Injuries and Fatalities (numbers broken down by participants)
Environmental Conditions (weather, lighting)
Outcome Details (damage estimates, law enforcement actions taken)
